# ExcetionAlge
Exceptional algebras for Magma.

The long term focus is to implement the Freudenthal-Tits Magic square.  So far we have
 * Composition Algebras
 * Simple Jordan Algebras
 * Nonassociative aglebras with involutions.
 * Properties for power associative algebras.
 
 We also maintain a list of semifields.
